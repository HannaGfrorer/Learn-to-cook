## Testing 

Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Safari. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.

Listed is the main issues discovered.

1. The CSS file did not work with the index.html file, no style ended up on the page
 - Solution: moved the css file to the assets folder and then it works
2. Hero-Image were not taking 100% of the screen's width.
 - Solution: Resized the images to a larger size.
3. 
4. When tested in Lighthouse the website received a low score on performance, 73. The reason for thas was that the images size were too big.
 - Solution: Resized all the images and score increased to 99.
5. Poor performance on smaller screens. About Us and 2022 Events sections did not place them selfs properly.
 - Solution: Solved this by using media queries and now the elements are displayed as they should.
6. Menu not properly aligned with header on small screens and it gets cropped and divided.
 - Solution: Added new values in the existing media queries.
7. Menu still gets cropped on screens with resolutions below 320px. It looks good using Google DevTools but not on a physical device
